Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Support up to 256 colors.

Version 0.1.7:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix two bugs in the initialisation code which would cause memory leaks
	  when calling t3_term_init more than once (which is a normal use-case when
	  suspending a program).

Version 0.1.6:
	Bug fixes:
	- Using characters with a zero attribute caused incorrect positioning of
	  text placed over the top of it, when the upper text started to the left
	  of the lower text and overlapped with the lower text. This was mainly
	  visible when using the black-and-white mode.

Version 0.1.5:
	New features:
	- Added a function to release all memory allocated internally by
	  libt3window, to aid in debugging.

Version 0.1.4:
	New features:
	- Added a routine to retrieve the visible window at a specific coordinate.

	Miscelaneous changes:
	- Use libunistring instead of libt3unicode.

	Bug fixes:
	- Alternate character set characters are now no longer pushed through the
	  character set conversion routines.
	- Detection of UTF-8 capabilities is improved and more conservative.

Version 0.1.3:
	Miscelaneous changes:
	- Follow libtranscript API change.

Version 0.1.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Separate input and output file descriptor for stdin/stdout. Using stdout
	  for input caused problems on some systems.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release
