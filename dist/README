Introduction
============

The libt3window library provides functions for manipulating the terminal and
for creating (possibly overlapping) windows on a terminal. libt3window can be
used instead of (n)curses for drawing on the terminal. libt3window provides
the following features:

  - (Overlapping) windows for drawing. Overlapping windows hide windows deeper
	in the window stack.
  - Clipping of windows to the size of the parent window.
  - UTF-8 used internally, which is converted to the terminal encoding before
    output. libt3window depends on libunistring for UTF-8 processing and
	libtranscript for character set conversion.
  - Provides easy access to the most needed terminal functionality.
  - Small code size.

libt3window is part of the Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3)
[http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/]

libt3window is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. See the
file COPYING for details.


Prerequisites and installation
==============================

libt3window requires the GNU libtool utility to be compiled. Furthermore, it
requires (n)curses or ncurses's libtinfo for access to the terminfo database,
libtranscript and libunistring.

There are two ways in which to compile libt3window:

Using the configure script:
---

$ ./configure
or
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
(see ./configure --help for more tuning options)
$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

Manually editing the Makefile to suit your computer:
---

$ cp Makefile.in Makefile

Edit the values for the different variables, using the comments in the
Makefile for guidance, to suit your environment.

$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

The Makefiles in the distribution should work on all POSIX compatible make's.
They have been tested using both GNU make and BSD make.


Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of libt3window [http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/libt3window.html]. When
reporting bugs, please include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.
