@section Introduction

The libt3window library provides functions for manipulating the terminal and
for creating (possibly overlapping) windows on a terminal. libt3window can be
used instead of (n)curses for drawing on the terminal. libt3window provides
the following features:

  - (Overlapping) windows for drawing. Overlapped windows hide windows deeper
	in the window stack.
  - UTF-8 used internally, which is converted to the terminal encoding before
    output. libt3window depends on libt3unicode for UTF-8 processing and iconv
    for character set conversion.
  - Provides easy access to the most needed terminal functionality.
  - Small code size.

@section Example

The example below shows a small program which displays two overlapping windows.
When the user presses a key the front window is hidden, showing the previously
partially obscured window. To make the windows clearly visable a box is drawn
around each window.
