- UTF-8 detection
- is special handling even required for single byte encodings? or can we simply
  use the mb stuff to handle this.

- UTF-8/multibyte locale detection and changin win_addstr calls automatically
- should the windows be filled with spaces by default?? That is, should
  they by default hide the underlying characters?
- more attribute painting stuff
- zero-width characters at start of line?
- program alternatives
- add mode in which updates to cursor aren't flushed until the next
  term_refresh or similar special function. The point is to limit the number of
  flushes so as to optimize the output
