- UTF-8 detection
- is special handling even required for single byte encodings? or can we simply
  use the mb stuff to handle this.

- UTF-8/multibyte locale detection and changin win_addstr calls automatically
- should the windows be filled with spaces by default?? That is, should
  they by default hide the underlying characters?
- more attribute painting stuff
- zero-width characters at start of line?
- program alternatives
- add mode in which updates to cursor aren't flushed until the next
  term_refresh or similar special function. The point is to limit the number of
  flushes so as to optimize the output


From the tcgetattr man-page:

 Raw mode
       cfmakeraw()  sets  the terminal to something like the "raw" mode of the
       old Version 7 terminal driver: input is available character by  charac-
       ter,  echoing is disabled, and all special processing of terminal input
       and output characters is disabled.  The terminal attributes are set  as
       follows:

           termios_p->c_iflag &= ~(IGNBRK | BRKINT | PARMRK | ISTRIP
                           | INLCR | IGNCR | ICRNL | IXON);
           termios_p->c_oflag &= ~OPOST;
           termios_p->c_lflag &= ~(ECHO | ECHONL | ICANON | ISIG | IEXTEN);
           termios_p->c_cflag &= ~(CSIZE | PARENB);
           termios_p->c_cflag |= CS8;
